![diagram](apps-demo.drawio.png)

## App
- Creates traceparent header with [this library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/traceparent)
- javascript client with axios that makes the following:
  - makes GET requests constantly, with a delay between 0.2ms and 1.5s, to bff1/car/carID, where carID is a randomly generated integer between 1 and 1000000
  - makes POST requests constantly, with a delay between 0.2ms and 1.5s, to bff2/car/carID/extras/extraID, where carID and extraID are randomly generated integer between 1 and 1000000
  - all requests it makes have a header named 'Traceparent' with contents generated with https://www.npmjs.com/package/traceparent

## BFF 1
- bff1.apps-demo
- nodejs server that receives GET requests at /car/carID, where carID is an integer value
  - when it receives the requests, it makes a new GET request to backend1 at GET /data/car/carID
  - it receives the response from backend1 and forwards the response
- it forwards the traceparent header it receives from the client and forwards it in its requests

## BFF 2
- bff2.apps-demo
- nodejs server that receives POST requests at /car/carID/extras/extraID, where carID and extraID are integer values
  - when it receives the requests, it makes a new GET request to backend1 at GET /data/car/carID/extras/extraID
  - 1% of the time it returns a 500 or 503 or 504 or 403 error
  - otherwise, it returns the response from backend1 and forwards the response
- it forwards the traceparent header it receives from the client and forwards it in its requests

## Backend 1
- backend1.apps-demo
- nodejs server that receives GET requests at /data/car/carID and /data/car/carID/extras/extraID, where carID and extraID are integer values
  - for endpoint /data/car/carID, return a 404 error 2% of the time. otherwise, return a string "your car ID has full battery"
  - for endpoint /data/car/carID/extras/extraID, return a 502 or 401 0.5% of the time. otherwise, make a POST to /sales/extra on backend2
- it forwards the traceparent header it receives from the client and forwards it in its requests

## Backend 2
- backend2.apps-demo
- nodejs server that receives POST requests at /sales/extras
  - 1.5% of the time it returns a 400 or 500 error. otherwise, return return 201
